        <p>Andhra Pradesh, state of India, located in the southeastern part of the subcontinent. It is bounded by the Indian states of Tamil Nadu to the south, Karnataka to the southwest and west, Telangana to the northwest and north, and Odisha to the northeast. The eastern boundary is a 600-mile (970-km) coastline along the Bay of Bengal. Telangana was a region within Andhra Pradesh for almost six decades, but in 2014 it was carved off to form a separate state. The capital of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is Hyderabad, in west-central Telangana.</p>
        <p>The state draws its name from the Andhra people, who have inhabited the area since antiquity and developed their own language, Telugu. Andhra Pradesh came into existence in its present form in 1956 as a result of the demand of the Andhras for a separate state. Although it is primarily agricultural, the state has some mining activity and a significant amount of industry. Area 106,204 square miles (275,068 square km). Pop. (2011) 84,665,533.</p></td></tr></table>

            <p>After India gained independence in 1947, however, the region remained administratively and linguistically divided. In 1950 the southern and eastern Andhra portion was incorporated into Madras state, and the Telangana region became part of Hyderabad state. The Andhras’ demand for separate statehood became so insistent that, when the central government refused to comply, a local leader, Potti Sreeramulu, fasted to death in 1952 to dramatize the issue. The government finally acceded to the people’s request by creating, on October 1, 1953, Andhra state, which included the Telugu-speaking districts of the former Madras state to the south. That action paved the way for the formation of linguistic states throughout India, beginning in 1956 and continuing into the 21st century. Through the States Reorganization Act of 1956, the state of Hyderabad was split up, and its Telugu-speaking districts (constituting Telangana) were joined to the Andhra state on November 1, 1956, to form the new state of Andhra Pradesh.</p>


<p>A special feature of the new state government was the creation of regional committees for Telangana and Rayalaseema. The purpose of the committees was to ensure that the views of the people of those two regions were heard and that regional interests were protected, since the areas were economically and educationally less-advanced than the coastal Andhra areas. However, as it became apparent that Telangana (with the exception of Hyderabad city) was consistently lagging behind the coastal areas economically and socially, a movement arose in the late 1960s to separate Telangana from the rest of Andhra Pradesh.</p>

<p>Demonstrations by pro-separatists were forcefully put down by the government in late 1969, and the movement languished for a number of years. By the start of the 21st century, however, the demand for a Telangana separate from Andhra Pradesh had grown dramatically, spearheaded by the establishment in 2001 of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, a political party dedicated to creating the new state. Years of discussions followed, as those in what would remain of Andhra Pradesh strongly opposed giving up to Telangana Hyderabad, the state’s most populous and economically important city. An agreement was finally reached that designated Hyderabad as capital of both states for 10 years, after which it would be the capital solely of Telangana. In February 2014 both chambers of the Indian parliament gave final approval for the creation of Telangana, which became India’s 29th state on June 2. </p>

        <table class="cul"><tr><td> <p>The Andhras’ contribution to India’s cultural heritage is substantial. Architecture and painting have been highly developed arts in the region since ancient times. The kuchipudi style of dance is unique in the Indian tradition, while Karnatak (South Indian) music has derived much from Andhra roots. Many of southern India’s major composers of classical Indian music have been Andhras, and Telugu has been the language of most of the compositions. Telugu, one of the four literary languages of the Dravidian family, occupies a prestigious place among Indian languages, being renowned for its antiquity and admired by many for its mellifluous quality. Telugu literature was prominent in the Indian literary renaissance of the 19th and 20th centuries, as the writing resonated with a revolution in literary forms and expression, stimulated to a large degree by Western genres. Andhra Pradesh has many periodicals in English, Telugu, and Urdu. Muslim culture in the Telangana region further enriches the state’s cultural diversity.</p>


<p>Before Indian independence, arts and literature thrived mostly under the sponsorship of royal patrons and private organizations, many of which still function. Since independence, the state has created autonomous academies to revive, popularize, and promote fine arts, dance, drama, music, and literature. The conscious cultivation of cultural expression is more an urban than a rural phenomenon, for cultural performances, literary meetings, and religious discussions occur mostly in towns or cities. Cultural development in different parts of the state under different historical circumstances resulted in the occurrence of recognizable variations in dialect, in caste structure, and in other traditions, all of which ultimately served to diversify the rural arts. Rural cultural media such as balladry, puppetry, and storytelling are indigenous to the area; use of those media in social and political communication is also common. The penetration of the mass media, especially radio and television, and of Internet access into rural areas helped to bring an awareness of classical traditions to the rural communities and of rural arts to the urban population.</p></td></tr></table>

    <p>The climate of Andhra Pradesh varies considerably, depending on the geographical region. Summers last from March to June. In the coastal plain, the summer temperatures are generally higher than the rest of the state, with temperature ranging between 20 and 41 °C (68 and 106 °F). July to September is the season for tropical rains. About one-third of the total rainfall is brought by the northeast monsoon. October and November see low-pressure systems and tropical cyclones form in the Bay of Bengal which, along with the northeast monsoon, bring rains to the southern and coastal regions of the state.</p>

<p>November, December, January, and February are the winter months in Andhra Pradesh. Since the state has a long coastal belt the winters are not very cold. The range of winter temperature is generally 12 to 30 °C (54 to 86 °F). Lambasingi in Visakhapatnam district is also nicknamed as the "Kashmir of Andhra Pradesh" due to its relatively cool climate as compared to others and the temperature ranges from 0 to 10 °C (32 to 50 °F)</p>
