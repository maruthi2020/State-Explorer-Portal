        <p>Maharashtra, state of India, occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan plateau in the western peninsular part of the subcontinent. Its shape roughly resembles a triangle, with the 450-mile (725-km) western coastline forming the base and its interior narrowing to a blunt apex some 500 miles (800 km) to the east. Maharashtra is bounded by the Indian states of Gujarat to the northwest, Madhya Pradesh to the north, Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to the southeast, Karnataka to the south, and Goa to the southwest and by the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and the Arabian Sea to the west.</p>
        <p>Maharashtra’s capital, Mumbai (formerly Bombay), is an island city on the western coast, connected to the mainland by roads and railways. Aptly called the gateway of India, Maharashtra is one of India’s biggest commercial and industrial centres, and it has played a significant role in the country’s social and political life.</p>
        <p>Maharashtra is a leader among Indian states in terms of agricultural and industrial production, trade and transport, and education. Its ancient culture, at one stage considerably obscured by British dominance, survives largely through the medium of a strong literary heritage. A common literature in Marathi, the predominant language of the state, has in fact played an important role in nurturing a sense of unity among the Maharashtrians. Area 118,800 square miles (307,690 square km). Pop. (2011) 112,372,972.

            <tr><td>
            <p>The name Maharashtra, denoting the western upland of the Deccan plateau, first appeared in a 7th-century inscription and in the account of Xuanzang, a Chinese traveler at that time. According to one interpretation, the name derives from the word maharathi (great chariot driver), which refers to a skillful northern fighting force that migrated southward into the area. The group’s language, intermingled with the speech of the earlier Naga settlers, became Maharastri, which by the 8th century had developed into Marathi. There was also a continuous influx of people from remote Greece and Central Asia.</p>
<p>During that early period the territory constituting the present-day state of Maharashtra was divided between several Hindu kingdoms: Satavahana, Vakataka, Kalacuri, Rashtrakuta, Chalukya, and Yadava. A succession of Muslim dynasties ruled after 1307. Persian, the court language of the Muslims, had a far-reaching effect on the Marathi language. By the mid-16th century, Maharashtra was again fragmented between several independent Muslim rulers, who fought each other endlessly. It was in the midst of that chaos that a great leader, Shivaji, was born in 1627. Shivaji showed astonishing prowess by founding a large Maratha empire that shook Delhi-based Mughal rule to its foundations.

During the 18th century almost all of western and central India, as well as large segments of the north and east, was brought under the suzerainty of the Maratha confederacy, an alliance formed after Shivaji’s kingdom had collapsed. Europeans, however, had been present along the coast since the early 16th century. Britain gained control of Bombay Island in 1661, and from the early 19th century onward the Marathas gradually succumbed to British expansion on the mainland. The British proceeded to establish an administrative province known as the Bombay Presidency. After India gained its independence in 1947, the province became Bombay state (1950). A number of former princely states (notably Baroda [now Vadodara]) subsequently were merged into the new state.</p>
<p>On November 1, 1956, in a major linguistic and political reorganization of the states of peninsular India, Bombay state received large parts of Madhya Pradesh, as well as the northwestern portion of the dismembered Hyderabad state (which had been formed after Indian independence from the former Hyderabad princely state). The outcome of that reorganization, however, was still a linguistically divided state, in which most of the Gujarati-speaking peoples lived in the north and most of the Marathi-speaking peoples lived in the south. Demands by the two language groups that the state be divided into two parts resulted, on May 1, 1960, in the creation of Gujarat in the north and the newly renamed Maharashtra in the south. Bombay, remaining part of Maharashtra, became the new state’s capital. The city’s name was changed to Mumbai in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>Since independence the state’s politics have been largely controlled by the Indian National Congress (Congress Party). Early chief ministers (heads of government) included Morarji Desai (served 1952–56), who later was India’s prime minister (1977–79), and Yashwantrao Balwantrao Chavan (1956–62), who was widely heralded for his efforts to modernize the state’s economic and social policies. Interruptions in the Congress Party’s rule included two years (1978–80) when Sharad Pawar put together an anti-Congress coalition (although Pawar subsequently headed Congress governments in 1988–91 and 1993–95), and four years (1995–99) when the pro-Hindu Shiv Sena (“Army of Shiva”) party (founded and long dominated by journalist Bal Thackeray) controlled the government. In addition, another pro-Hindu party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, won a plurality of seats in the 2014 state legislative elections and was able to form a ruling coalition.</p>

        <table class="cul"><tr><td> <p>Ancient temples, fortresses, and cave works reflect the rich history of Madhya Pradesh. In the foothills of the Vindhya Range, prehistoric paintings dating from roughly 10,000 BCE adorn the walls of the Bhimbetka rock shelters (designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2003). In west-central Madhya Pradesh, one of the state’s oldest historical monuments is the stupa (Buddhist mound forming a memorial shrine) at Sanchi, near Vidisha. Originally constructed by Ashoka, emperor of India from about 265 to 238 BCE, the stupa was expanded by the Shunga kings, who ruled the area during the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. The remains of another stupa, dating to about 175 BCE, were excavated in Bharhut, near Satna, and are now housed in the Indian Museum at Kolkata; the distinctive narrative style of decoration found on this stupa is known as Bharhut sculpture.</p>
        <p>Some of the most remarkable ancient artwork of Madhya Pradesh is found in caves. The Bagh caves, near the western town of Mhow, are adorned with paintings on Buddhist topics that date roughly to the 5th century CE. Stemming from about the same period (4th to 7th century) are the Udayagiri caves (Brahmanical and Jaina monasteries), near Vidisha, which exhibit artwork and rock-cut architecture similar to those of the well-known Udayagiri caves in the neighbouring state of Orissa.The Khajuraho temples, in northern Madhya Pradesh, are widely recognized for their erotic art; they were built by the Chandela kings, who ruled in the region roughly from the early 9th to the mid-11th century. The 14th- and 15th-century palaces and mosque at Mandu, near the western town of Dhar, and the Gwalior fort—perhaps the most impressive of the residences of the former princes of Madhya Pradesh—also constitute notable architectural achievements.</p>
        <p>The state has several well-known annual cultural events, such as Kalidas Samaroh (for the visual and performing arts) in Ujjain, Tansen Samaroh (classical music) in Gwalior, and a dance festival in Khajuraho, where artists from all over India participate. In Bhopal there is a unique multifaceted cultural complex, the Bharat Bhavan, which functions as a meeting ground for artists from various fields; the sprawling complex houses a museum, a library, an open-air theatre, and a number of conference halls. The state has important yearly religious melas (gatherings) in Mandsaur (Mandasor) and Ujjain, both in the Malwa region of western Madhya Pradesh.</p></td></tr></table>

    <p>The climate is subtropical to tropical (depending on elevation) and characteristically monsoonal (i.e., wet-dry), with local variations. India’s southwest monsoonal rains break on the Mumbai coast usually in the first week of June and last until September, during which period they account for about four-fifths of the annual rainfall. Four seasons are normal: March–May (hot and dry), June–September (hot and wet), October–November (warm and dry), and December–February (cool and dry).

The Western Ghats and the ranges on the northern borders greatly influence the climate and separate the wet Konkan Coast from the dry interior upland, an area called the Desh. Rainfall is extremely heavy in Konkan, averaging about 100 inches (2,540 mm), with some of the wettest spots receiving up to 250 inches (6,350 mm), but rapidly diminishes to one-fifth of that amount east of the Ghats. Rainfall increases again in the eastern areas, reaching about 40 to 80 inches (1,000 to 2,000 mm) in the extreme east.</p>
    <p>The coastal regions enjoy equable temperatures; monthly averages at Mumbai are in the low 80s F (about 27–28 °C). A change of more than about 13 °F (7 °C) between day and night temperatures is unusual. Pune (Poona), higher up on the plateau, benefits from cooler temperatures throughout the year. In the interior, average summer temperatures reach into the low 100s F (about 38–41 °C), and winter temperatures average in the low 70s F (about 21–23 °C).</p>
