            <tr><td>
            <p>Sanskrit writings dating to about 1000 BCE mention that “Andhra” people were living in the region now occupied by Telangana state, but historical references begin only with the Mauryan dynasty (late 4th to early 2nd century BCE) to the north. The great Mauryan emperor Ashoka (reigned c. 265–238 BCE) sent Buddhist missions to the Andhras in the south. The Buddhist Satavahana (or Satakarni) dynasty of the Andhras assumed power in about the 1st century CE and came to control nearly all of the Deccan. They were patrons of diverse religions, and they also were great builders; their principal city, Amaravati (now in Andhra Pradesh), contained Buddhist monuments that inaugurated a new style of architecture. Some of the renowned paintings in the Ajanta Caves in Maharashtra have been linked to the Andhra painters of that period. Buddhism prospered under the Andhras, and in their capital flourished the great Buddhist university of antiquity, where Nagarjuna (c. 150–250 CE), the founder of the Mahayana school of Buddhism, taught. The ruins of the university are at Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>The Andhras remained in power until the 11th century, when the eastern Chalukya dynasty unified most of the Andhra area. Under the Hindu Chalukyas, the first of the Telugu poets, Nannaya Bhatta, began translating the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata into Telugu, thus inaugurating Telugu as a literary medium. During the 12th and 13th centuries the dynasty of the Kakatiyas of Warangal extended Andhra power militarily and culturally, including expanding its commercial activities toward Southeast Asia.

Meanwhile, Muslims had established themselves in the north and then invaded the south. Warangal fell in 1323, but the rise of the Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar, southwest of Warangal, kept Muslim expansion in check for some time. Vijayanagar, one of the greatest kingdoms in Indian history, reached a peak under King Krishna Deva Raya (reigned 1509–29). His rule was noted for military conquest, economic prosperity, good administration, and artistic splendour. Telugu literature flourished during his rule. However, an alliance between the various neighbouring Muslim principalities ultimately led to the fall of Vijayanagar in 1565, leaving the Muslims in control of the Telangana region. The Quṭb Shāhī kingdom, centred on Golconda (near Hyderabad), was conquered in 1687 by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.</p>
<p>By the 17th century, European traders had become involved in Indian politics. In Telangana, successive nizams (rulers) of the princely state of Hyderabad sought to consolidate their kingdom against rivals by obtaining first French and later British support. Nizam ʿĀlī accepted British ascendancy in Hyderabad in 1767, and by 1798 another ruler, Nizam ʿĀlī Khan, had been forced to enter into an agreement that placed Hyderabad under British protection, although he maintained his independence on internal matters.

Hyderabad stayed loyal to the British during the second and third Maratha Wars (1803–05, 1817–19) and the Indian Mutiny (1857–58), and it remained a peaceful princely state as the Indian people increased their demand for independence from Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A movement was organized to unite the Telugu-speaking peoples living under British rule with those under the nizam’s administration. After India gained independence in 1947, Nizam Osman Ali initially chose to remain independent, but in September 1948 Indian troops invaded to force the issue. Hyderabad acceded to the union in 1949 and became a state in 1950</p>

Telugu, one of the four literary languages of the Dravidian family, occupies a prestigious place among Indian languages, being renowned for its antiquity and admired by many for its mellifluous quality. Telugu literature was prominent in the Indian literary renaissance of the 19th and 20th centuries, as the writing resonated with a revolution in literary forms and expression, stimulated to a large degree by Western genres. Telangana has many periodicals in English, Telugu, and Urdu. Muslim culture in the state further enriches its cultural diversity.</p>
