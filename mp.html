        <p>Madhya Pradesh, state of India. As its name implies—madhya means “central” and pradesh means “region” or “state”—it is situated in the heart of the country. The state has no coastline and no international frontier. It is bounded by the states of Uttar Pradesh to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the southeast, Maharashtra to the south, Gujarat to the southwest, and Rajasthan to the northwest. The capital is Bhopal, in the west-central part of the state. Area 119,016 square miles (308,252 square km). Pop. (2011) 72,597,565.</p>

            <p>Rock paintings and stone and metal implements found in the rivers, valleys, and other areas of Madhya Pradesh indicate that the area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. One of the earliest kingdoms known to have existed in the region was Avanti, with its capital at Ujjain. Located in the western part of present-day Madhya Pradesh, this state was part of the Mauryan empire (4th–3rd century BCE) and was later known as Malwa. Attracted by the region’s fertile black soils, settlers from different parts of India migrated to Malwa via three important migratory routes—from the western coast, from the Deccan plateau, and from the ancient city of Shravasti and its surrounding territory in the north.</p>

<h3>Dynastic rule</h3>
<p>Among the various dynasties that ruled part or all of Madhya Pradesh between the 2nd century BCE and the end of the 10th century CE were the Shungas (c. 185–c. 73 BCE), who ruled in eastern Malwa, the Satavahanas (1st or 3rd century BCE–3rd century CE), the Shakas (2nd–4th century CE), and the Nagas (2nd–4th century CE). The whole of Madhya Pradesh lying north of the Narmada River formed part of the Gupta empire (4th–5th century CE) and was the scene of a power struggle against the nomadic Hephthalites (Hunas) and the Kalachuris, the latter of whom occupied part of Malwa but only for a brief period. Yashodharman was the Malwan king who defeated the Hephthalites in the 6th century. During the first part of the 7th century, Malwa was annexed by the emperor of northern India, Harsha (Harahavardhana).

By the 10th century the Kalachuris had risen again to occupy eastern Madhya Pradesh, including the Narmada valley; their contemporaries were the Paramaras of Dhar in what is now the western region, the Kachwahas of Gwalior in the north, and the Chandelas of Khajuraho, about 100 miles (160 km) southeast of Jhansi. Later the Tomaras ruled at Gwalior, and the tribal Gonds ruled over several districts.</p>
<p>When India became independent in 1947, the new states of Madhya Bharat and Vindhya Pradesh were carved out of the old Central India Agency. Three years later, in 1950, the Central Provinces and Berar was renamed Madhya Pradesh. With the States Reorganization Act of 1956, Madhya Pradesh was redistributed along linguistic lines. The act transferred the southern Marathi-speaking districts of Madhya Pradesh to the Bombay state (now in Maharashtra) and merged several Hindi-speaking areas—the states of Bhopal and Vindhya Pradesh, as well as most of Madhya Bharat—with Madhya Pradesh. In 2000 its eastern provinces became the state of Chhattisgarh.</p>

        <table class="cul"><tr><td> <p>Ancient temples, fortresses, and cave works reflect the rich history of Madhya Pradesh. In the foothills of the Vindhya Range, prehistoric paintings dating from roughly 10,000 BCE adorn the walls of the Bhimbetka rock shelters (designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2003). In west-central Madhya Pradesh, one of the state’s oldest historical monuments is the stupa (Buddhist mound forming a memorial shrine) at Sanchi, near Vidisha. Originally constructed by Ashoka, emperor of India from about 265 to 238 BCE, the stupa was expanded by the Shunga kings, who ruled the area during the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. The remains of another stupa, dating to about 175 BCE, were excavated in Bharhut, near Satna, and are now housed in the Indian Museum at Kolkata; the distinctive narrative style of decoration found on this stupa is known as Bharhut sculpture.</p>
        <p>Some of the most remarkable ancient artwork of Madhya Pradesh is found in caves. The Bagh caves, near the western town of Mhow, are adorned with paintings on Buddhist topics that date roughly to the 5th century CE. Stemming from about the same period (4th to 7th century) are the Udayagiri caves (Brahmanical and Jaina monasteries), near Vidisha, which exhibit artwork and rock-cut architecture similar to those of the well-known Udayagiri caves in the neighbouring state of Orissa.The Khajuraho temples, in northern Madhya Pradesh, are widely recognized for their erotic art; they were built by the Chandela kings, who ruled in the region roughly from the early 9th to the mid-11th century. The 14th- and 15th-century palaces and mosque at Mandu, near the western town of Dhar, and the Gwalior fort—perhaps the most impressive of the residences of the former princes of Madhya Pradesh—also constitute notable architectural achievements.</p>
        <p>The state has several well-known annual cultural events, such as Kalidas Samaroh (for the visual and performing arts) in Ujjain, Tansen Samaroh (classical music) in Gwalior, and a dance festival in Khajuraho, where artists from all over India participate. In Bhopal there is a unique multifaceted cultural complex, the Bharat Bhavan, which functions as a meeting ground for artists from various fields; the sprawling complex houses a museum, a library, an open-air theatre, and a number of conference halls. The state has important yearly religious melas (gatherings) in Mandsaur (Mandasor) and Ujjain, both in the Malwa region of western Madhya Pradesh.</p></td></tr></table>

    <p>The climate in Madhya Pradesh is governed by a monsoon weather pattern. The distinct seasons are summer (March through May), winter (November through February), and the intervening rainy months of the southwest monsoon (June through September). The summer is hot, dry, and windy; in Bhopal, low temperatures average in the upper 70s F (about 25 °C), while high temperatures typically reach the low 100s F (about 40 °C). Winters are usually pleasant and dry, with daily temperatures normally rising from about 50° (about 10 °C) into the upper 70s F (about 25 °C). Temperatures during the monsoon season usually range from the low 70s F (low 20s C) to the upper 80s F (low 30s C).</p>
    <p>The average annual rainfall is about 44 inches (1,100 mm). In general, precipitation decreases westward and northward, from 60 inches (1,500 mm) or more in the east to about 32 inches (800 mm) in the west. The Chambal valley in the north averages less than 30 inches (750 mm) of rainfall per year. Most parts of Madhya Pradesh receive almost all of their precipitation in the monsoon months; however, there is considerable rainfall over the northern part of the state in December and January.</p>

<p> The Khajuraho erotic temples are one of the top historical destinations in India. If you want proof that the Kama Sutra originated in India, Khajuraho is the place to visit. There are over 20 temples abounding in erotic sculptures. However, more than that, they show a celebration of love, life, and worship.</p>

<h2>Bandhavgarh National Park</h2>

<p>  Bandhavgarh and Kanha National Parks are among the top national parks in India. Bandhavgarh, while being relatively difficult to reach and costly to visit, is the best place to see tigers in the wild in India. The park features dense green valleys and rocky hill terrain, with an ancient fort. In addition to tigers, the park has a large array of wildlife including sloth bears, deer, leopards, jackals, and birds.

</p>

<h2>Kanha National Park</h2>

<p> Kanha National Park has the honor of providing the inspiration for Rudyard Kipling’s classic novel, The Jungle Book. It’s rich in lush saal and bamboo forests, lakes, streams, and open grasslands. As well as tigers, the park abounds with barasingha (swamp deer) and an extensive variety of other animals and birds. Rather than offering one particular kind of animal, it provides an all-round nature experience. The park is well regarded for its research and conservation programs, and many endangered species have been saved there</p>

<h2>Gwalior</h2>
<table><tr><td width="100%"><img src="https://toib.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/gwalior-fort.jpg" align="left" width="600px" height="300px"></td></tr></table> 
<p>The great thing about Gwalior is that it's so accessible -- only two hours drive from Agra and the Taj Mahal in Uttar Pradesh. The main attraction the massive hilltop fort that towers over the city. Reputed to be one of the most invincible forts in India, its history stretches back over 1,000 years. Inside the fort walls are a number of palaces and temples, the highlight being the Man Mandir Palace. At the bottom of the fort is the Old Town of Gwalior, brimming with history and fine examples of Mughal architecture such as the Tomb of Tansen. The Tansen Music Festival is held at the tomb every December.</p>

<h2>Orchha</h2>

<p>Orchha is located on the banks of the Betwa River, a comfortable hour and a half south of Gwalior. It's another relatively peaceful place, full of well-preserved palaces and temples, with a distinctly medieval charm. Three main palaces are enclosed in Orccha's fortified walls. The Jahangir Mahal is the largest and most impressive, and its upper levels offer some arresting panoramic views. A stay inside the Jahangir Mahal, at the Hotel Sheesh Mahal, completes the experience. Being a government-run hotel, it's not luxurious but it is full of character.</p>
<h2>Bhopal</h2>

<p> Madhya Pradesh's capital city, Bhopal, is perhaps best known for the tragic poisoning that occurred there in 1984 when a pesticide manufacturing plant leaked a mixture of deadly gases. The city has two main attractions -- mosques and museums. A particularly fascinating museum is the Tribal Museum, which showcases the tribes of the region and their lives. The Taj ul Masjid, Jama Masjid, and Moti Masjid are fine examples of the city's rich Islamic heritage. There are also two large lakes, the Upper Lake and Lower Lake, inside the city limits.

One of India's little-known UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Bhimbetka rock shelters, is situated about an hour from Bhopal inside Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary. There are more than ancient 700 rock shelters there, dating all the way back to the Paleolithic age. Many of them have paintings on the walls.</p>

<p> Sanchi Stupa, northeast of Bhopal, is one of India's oldest Buddhist monuments and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was built by Emperor Ashoka in 262 BC after he embraced Buddhism and nonviolence, following his particularly horrific invasion of Kalinga (present-day Odisha). The complex is made up of a number of other stupas, temples, monasteries, pillars and relics. There's also an archeological museum. Sanchi can be visited on a day trip from Bhopal, but it's worth staying in the area as it's a convenient base for numerous other side trips.</p>

<p>Maheshwar, the Varanasi of central India, is a small holy town dedicated to Lord Shiva. Set along the banks of the Narmada river, it's said that only Shiva is worshiped where the Narmada flows, as he's the only god with the inner peace to calm her</p>
